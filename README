On start up:
Setup the path by adding appropriate path to where the directory is saved in the first functional line of code i.e. path=""

Set up alias in .bash_alias file and add todo=path+\"/main.sh\"
All of the above will hopefully be done automatically in upcoming versions.

Commands
> todo timer

> todo ls
lists all branches (1 repesents active branch)
> todo

> todo all
lists all notes from all branches
> todo add \"notes\"

> todo del <num>

> todo backup

> todo new <branch-name>

> todo rm <branch-name>

Colour Scheme:
How the colour scheme reflects on your terminal depends on the inherent shell colour scheme as well. Can be edited by changing the setaf values in the first 15 lines of main.sh The number has to be between 1 and 256.
